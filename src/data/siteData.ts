    content: [
      'As organizations accelerate their migration journeys to SAP S/4HANA, the historical temptation to heavily modify the ERP core with thousands of unmanaged custom Z-tables and modifications poses a severe risk to future innovation and cloud upgrades.',
      'The modern paradigm recommended by leading enterprise architects is the "Clean Core" strategy. By keeping the central ERP standard and upgrade-ready, enterprises can adopt new quarterly feature releases and statutory patches without undergoing months of costly regression testing.',
      'At ZisanTech Solutions, our enterprise architecture practice empowers clients to achieve rapid business customization without polluting the ERP core. We achieve this through three foundational pillars:',
      '1. Side-by-Side Cloud Extensions on SAP BTP: Building custom business applications, dealer portals, and supplier approval cockpits in SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP), communicating strictly through released APIs and OData services.',
      '2. ABAP RESTful Application Programming (RAP): For required in-app extensions, developing strictly within RAP and CDS views, guaranteeing zero upgrade breakage.',
